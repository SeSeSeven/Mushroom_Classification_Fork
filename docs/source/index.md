Welcome to the documentation for the Mushroom Classification Project. This documentation will help you understand the project's structure, setup, and usage.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the original and processed datasets.
- `docs/` - Contains the project documentation.
- `models/` - Contains trained models and model summaries.
- `notebooks/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
- `src/` - Contains source code for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- `tests/` - Contains test files.
- `reports/` - Contains generated analysis reports.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists the project's dependencies.
- `Makefile` - Provides convenience commands for common tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare the dataset: `make data`.
4. Train the model: `make train`.
5. Predict using the trained model: `make predict`.

## Usage

- Data Preparation: `make data`
- Model Training: `make train`
- Model Prediction: `make predict`
