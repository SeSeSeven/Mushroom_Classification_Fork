# Mushroom Species Classification


## Overall Goal

Deploy a model that can differentiate between mushroom species on an image.

## Framework

We will use [timm: PyTorch Image Models]([https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-pytorch-resources](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/index)), a collection of PyTorch computer vision models.

## Dataset

The data we have initially chosen to work with is a Mushroom Image dataset from Kaggle consisting of 6714 images of different types of mushrooms. There are in total 9 types of mushrooms: Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactarius, Russula and Suillus.

We want to split the data into training sets and test sets in an 80/20 ratio.
