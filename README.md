# Poisonous Mushroom Classification


## Overall Goal

To deploy a model that classifies an image of a mushroom as poisonous or not poisonous.

## Framework

We will use [timm: PyTorch Image Models]([https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-pytorch-resources](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/index)), a collection of PyTorch computer vision models.

## Dataset (initially, may change)

The data we have initially chosen to work with is a Mushroom Image dataset from Kaggle consisting of 6714 images different types of mushrooms. There are 9 total types of mushrooms: Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactarius, Russula and Suillus.
